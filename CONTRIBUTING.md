Thank you for your interest in contributing to GitHub Copilot for Eclipse! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit [https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** or later (CI uses Temurin 21; use a newer JDK if required by your Eclipse IDE)
- **Maven 3.8+** (or use the provided Maven wrapper `./mvnw`)
- **Node.js 22.13** or later, with npm
- **Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers 2025-12** or later (for development)
- Recommended: **Eclipse Checkstyle plugin** for code style compliance
  (e.g. install from update site: https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs-update-site/)

### Building the Project

Clone the repository, install the Copilot agent dependencies, and build with the Maven wrapper:

```shell
cd com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.core/copilot-agent
npm i -f
cd ../..
./mvnw clean package
```

The `npm i -f` step runs the Copilot agent `postinstall` script, which copies the language server files into
`com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.core/copilot-agent/dist/` and the platform-specific agent bundles required by the
Tycho build. The `-f` flag matches CI and lets npm proceed if the agent dependency tree has conflicts.

### Running Tests

```shell
./mvnw test
```

### Building the Update Site

```shell
./mvnw clean verify
```

The installable P2 repository is generated in `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.repository/target/repository/`.

### Running in Eclipse

1. Import all modules into your Eclipse workspace.
   * Select *File > Import... > General > Existing projects into Workspace*,
     select the root directory of the copilot-for-eclipse git repo,
     activate the check box *Search for nested projects*, and finish the wizard.
   * Do also import the agent bundle for your OS (e.g., `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.core.agent.win32`)
     after building the project with npm and maven or import all OS-specific agent bundles.
2. Activate one of the target platforms, i.e. open one of the target definition files and select `Set As Active Target Platform`.
   * `target-platforms/2025-12.target` (Eclipse 4.38 and later)
   * `target-platforms/2024-12.target` (Eclipse 4.36 and earlier)
3. For using the Checkstyle configuration (assuming you have installed the Eclipse Checkstyle plugin, see prerequisites),
   add a new named Checkstyle configuration.
   * Select *Window > Preferences > Checkstyle* and press the *New...* button.
   * Select Type="Project Relative Configuration", **name="copilot4eclipse"**, and choose the location using the *Browse...* button.
     The `checkstyle.xml` file is in the git repository root folder in the project "github-copilot-for-eclipse".
4. Use the launch configurations in the `launch/` directory, e.g. for launching a new Eclipse IDE with Copilot plug-ins.
   * Check the selected plug-ins in your launch configuration (in *Plug-ins* tab) and remove any OS-specific agent bundle that does not fit
     to your OS and remove all test bundles from the selected plug-ins from your Eclipse workspace.
   * Validate your config and ensure that all dependencies are resolved.
     Try *Select Required* button if something is missing.

## How to Contribute

## Project Structure

The project is a multi-module Maven/Tycho build consisting of OSGi bundles:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.core` | Core functionality: LSP client, authentication, chat/completion logic |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.ui` | User interface: chat view, completion UI, agent tools |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.ui.jobs` | Copilot Jobs view integration |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.terminal.api` | Terminal tool API definitions |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.ui.terminal` | Terminal integration (Eclipse 4.37+) |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.ui.terminal.tm` | TM Terminal integration (Eclipse 4.36 and earlier) |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.branding` | Product branding and about dialog |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.core.agent.*` | Platform-specific Copilot language server agent bundles |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.feature` | Eclipse feature definition |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.repository` | P2 update site |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.core.test` | Core bundle tests |
| `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.ui.test` | UI bundle tests |

## Code Style

This project enforces **Google Java Style** (with customizations) via Checkstyle. The configuration is in [`checkstyle.xml`](checkstyle.xml).

## Development Guidelines

### Threading

- **Never block the UI thread** with I/O or long-running operations.
- Use `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` or Eclipse `Job` API for background work.
- Always update SWT widgets on the UI thread using `Display.asyncExec()` or `Display.syncExec()`.

### Resource Management

- Dispose SWT resources (fonts, images) when done.
- Use try-with-resources for streams and Eclipse resources.
- Close editors before deleting files.

### Error Handling

- Use Eclipse `IStatus` / `Status` objects for error reporting.
- Log errors via `CopilotCore.getPlugin().logError(message, exception)`.
- Never silently swallow exceptions.

### Dependencies

- Minimize bundle dependencies — only add what is necessary.
- Avoid circular dependencies between bundles.
- Use `Require-Bundle` for essential dependencies, `Import-Package` for optional or version-flexible ones.

### Testing

- Use **JUnit 5** (Jupiter) for new tests.
- Name test classes `<ClassName>Test` or `<ClassName>Tests`.
- Name test methods descriptively: `testMethodName_scenario_expectedOutcome`.
- Clean up resources in teardown methods.
